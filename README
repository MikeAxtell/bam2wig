INSTALL
    bam2wig is a perl 5 program and so it requires perl 5 to compile. It
    expects that perl is located at /usr/bin/perl on your system. If not,
    please modify line 1 (the hashbang) of the script accordingly. It was
    built and tested using perl 5.

    Depending on your system, you may need super-user privileges to install
    bam2wig and/or its dependencies.

    samtools <http://www.htslib.org/> is a required dependency. Install
    samtools to your PATH before running bam2wig.

    wigToBigWig <http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/bigWig.html> is an
    optional dependency. If wigToBigWig is in your PATH, bam2wig will make a
    bigwig file in addition to a wiggle file.

    Once the dependencies are installed to your PATH, install bam2wig to
    your PATH for convenience

USAGE
    bam2wig [options] [alignments.bam]

OPTIONS
    -t [float] : Threshold for reporting. Defaults to 0 (all depths
    reported)

    -s [top/bottom/both] : Strand to report. Defaults to both. 'bottom' will
    quantify in negative numbers. Used in conjunction with option -g will
    subset the loci to those on the indicated strand.

    -r [string] : Limit analysis to specified read group

    -l [integer] : Minimum size of read to report. Default: no minimum.

    -L [integer] : Maximum size of read to report. Default: no maximum.

    -c [chr:start-stop] : Limit analysis to the indicated locus.

    -g [string] : Path to a GFF3 file. Loci in the GFF3 will be reported.
    Negates any setting of -c.

    -D [string] : Name of output directory. Defaults to
    [/YourBamsPath/YourBamsBasename_bam2wig/]

    -F [integer] : Sum of bits to pass to samtools view -F option .. which
    types of alignments to ignore. Default: 3844 ... which includes bits 4
    (unmapped reads), 256 (secondary alignments), 512 (failed QC), 1024 (PCR
    or optical duplicates), and 2048 (Supplementary alignments)

    -m : Count each as (1/(n mapped reads)) * 1E6. In other words, normalize
    to reads per million.

    -d : Treat as degradome/PARE data .. tally only the depths of 5' ends.
    Option -s must be either 'bottom' or 'top'

    -i : Instead of reporting abundance, report instead the FRACTIONS of
    reads that meet the size requirements set by -l and/or -L

    -h : Get help (print this message)

    -v : Print version number and quit

OUTPUT
    A wiggle file is written to the working directory. The wiggle file LACKS
    a track line at the top. If wigToBigWig is installed, a bigwig file will
    also be written to the working directory. The file name will include
    information on non-default settings. For instance, file name
    'mydata-t10-l20-L24.wig' indicates an analysis using option t set to 10,
    option l set to 20, and option L to to 24, with all other options left
    at their defaults.

BAM FILE REQUIREMENTS
    The input BAM file must be sorted by chromosome, indexed (use samtools
    index), and possess a valid header with all @SQ lines present and the
    sequence names and lengths indicated by SN and LN, respectively (see SAM
    format specification). If option -r is used, the read groups must also
    be specified in the header using the @RG lines, per the SAM spec.

USING A GFF3 FILE
    Using option -g allows the output to be restricted to the loci specified
    in gff3 file. When used under default setting of option -s (the strand
    set to 'both'), all loci from the GFF3 will be reported, and the values
    will represent the read coverage on BOTH strands, regardless of whether
    the gff3 locus is annotated as strand '+', '-', or '.'. When used with
    option -s set to "bottom", only GFF3 loci whose strand is annotated as
    "-" in the file will be used, and only the reads on the - strand of the
    reference analyzed. Conversely, when used with option -s set to "top",
    only GFF3 loci whose strand is annotated as "+" in the file will be
    used, and only the reads on the + strand of the reference analyzed.

DEGRADOME / PARE MODE
    Option -d triggers activation of degradome / PARE mode. In this mode,
    the depth of coverage of 5' ends of reads is tallied, instead of total
    depth of coverage across the whole bodies of the reads. This mode must
    have option -s (strand) set to either "top" or "bottom".
